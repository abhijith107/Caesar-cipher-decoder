Steps for designing and using a Caesar cipher

Choose a value to shift the alphabet by.

Make a table where the top row contains letters in standard alphabetical order, and the bottom row is the new shifted alphabet.

Encode the message by exchanging each letter in the message with the equivalent shifted letter.

Make sure that the messageâ€™s intended recipient knows the shifting scheme you used to encode the message so they can decode it.

To decrypt a message encoded with a Caesar cipher, simply take the value of 26 minus the shift value, and apply that new value to shift the encoded message back to its original form.
